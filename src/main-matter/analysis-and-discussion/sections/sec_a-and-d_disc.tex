\section{Discussion}\label{sec_a-and-d_disc}
I am discussing some results. 
\autoref{ssec_a-and-d_disc_reqs} lists the requirements for this section.

\subsection{Requirements}\label{ssec_a-and-d_disc_reqs}
Discuss your results and compare them (i.e. what matches and what doesn't match) with:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item your hypothesis; and
    \item similar results in your literature review.
    \item For any results that don't match, posit reasons why (based on the information in the literature review).
\end{enumerate}
